# Resources

## Getting started in Exacloud

A great tutorial created by Ted Laderas can be found [here](https://laderast.github.io/exacloud_tutorial/).
While the lustre system is no longer used for Exacloud, most of the other submission details are the same and this provides a great walkthrough.

More information on how to submit jobs can be found [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html).

If you are connected to the OHSU VPN, also check out the OHSU Wiki [here](https://wiki.ohsu.edu/display/ACC/Exacloud).
You will find information on basic access, FAQs, policy, and a user guide.

**Important note:**
Save your documents and environments in your `/home/groups/CEDAR/<your_username>` directory, not your `/home/users/<you_username>` directory. The latter has a very limited amount of space and should be limited to basic configuration files like your `.bashrc`.

## How to find the Comp Hub speaker rotation

You will need access to the Teams "Comp Hub working group" channel. Click the "Notes & Schedule" tab. On the far left is a small purple icon that resembles 3 books. Click this, then select "Schedule" then "Speaker Rotation - 2022-23". Alternatively, try clicking the link [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/0d820ecd-def2-4297-adad-78056cde7c78/_djb2_msteams_prefix_3814411637?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3Anull%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A9352a970dc9f4aa4a51da1569d3dc675%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&groupId=bf21840b-d228-40c8-bb63-9bffe3e9b98c&tenantId=e2737957-fab8-4d7e-94f6-9bd6af9f7158&allowXTenantAccess=false).
